the Fed and Treasury. News flash: I DONT NEED THE HELP! Our politicians are
all so old, out of touch and stupid.

We are witnessing the Twitter masses deciding the outcome of a $25B coin flip.
There is a US corporation that has a $50B balance sheet, generates a 10% ROIC
(~$5B of income per year) but has also convinced the US Government that: a) it
shouldnt pay taxes and should be treated as a non profit b) despite making
billions more than necessary to cover costs, only spends the government
mandated non-profit minimum of what it makes every year, creating an
artificial $1.5B deficit c) then asks the US government for help and gets
$1.5B of taxpayer dollars every year to cover the gap that they could cover by
themselves but chooses not to d) while getting government funding, has been
accused and found guilty by tue Supreme Court of systemic racial
discrimination towards minority groups This corporation is called the Harvard
Corporation.
