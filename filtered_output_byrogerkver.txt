My speech about Bitcoin hasn't changed since 2011. BTC has changed and is no
longer bitcoin.

Bitcoin maximalists only hold a single coin and want to pump it. I hold dozens
of coins and just want crypto to undermine the power of governments to control
peaceful people.

It took about a decade for crypto to grow to a market cap of $1 trillion, but
took just one quarter to add another trillion.
Today marks the 10 year anniversary of my first public mention of Bitcoin, and
of the day Satoshi disappeared.
Today marks an entire year since my last tweet. Think about how quickly the
time goes. Make sure you are spending it on important things.

If regular people are all using custodial wallets, Bitcoin will have lost a
key property that made it so revolutionary.
The only hope for a cryptocurrency to become a real store of value is for it
to have real-world utility.
EVM chains seem to be the future.

Vitalik is both a genius and a class act. Thats why I sold a portion of my
BTC for Ethereum in addition to lots of Bitcoin Cash.
I'll do my best to use [http://Bitcoin.com](https://t.co/6EeRmpfaH7) to
educate the world about how Bitcoin Core is no longer the Bitcoin that was
described on the original [http://Bitcoin.org](https://t.co/ydBxXGyTxU)
website or in the Satoshi White paper.
[#BitcoinCash](/hashtag/BitcoinCash?src=hashtag_click) is that Bitcoin.

Bitcoins usefulness as a store of value comes as a secondary effect from its
usefulness as a medium of exchange. If you destroy the medium of exchange, you
destroy the store of value.

Since Bitcoin Core is no longer usable as a currency, we should no longer
consider it to be a crypto currency.

2009-2013 Everyone knows Bitcoin is a CURRENCY. 2014 IRS dictates that Bitcoin
is a COMMODITY. 2014 Blockstream is formed and tries to morph Bitcoin into a
COMMODITY. 2017: Every real Bitcoiner knows the IRS is wrong. Bitcoin is a
CURRENCY and [#BitcoinCash](/hashtag/BitcoinCash?src=hashtag_click) is the
real Bitcoin.
Location:Saint Kitts and Nevis(https://twitter.com/places/ce1899c5b27d0caa)

The reason there is so much hostility from Bitcoin Core towards Bitcoin Cash
is because Core knows they have stolen the name but are advocating a
completely different system than what was originally described by Satoshi.
Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin

Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin. Bitcoin Core is not.
Location:Saint Kitts and Nevis(https://twitter.com/places/ce1899c5b27d0caa)

The current version of Bitcoin Cash can easily handle all of the Bitcoin Core
and Ethereum transactions combined.
Its easy to understand why Bitcoin Cash is better than Bitcoin Core.
Bitcoin Cash, unlike Bitcoin Core, is both a medium of exchange and a store of
value.
Bitcoin is BCH
There are two mutually exclusive ways of acquiring wealth: 1\. The economic
means of production and trade. 2\. The political means via the seizure of
anothers goods or services by the use of force and violence. Bitcoin enables
the economic and hinders the political.
BTC = central economic planning. BCH = the free market. Bitcoin is BCH

I wish BTC all the luck in the world, but it isn't the Bitcoin described in
the Bitcoin white paper, and it isn't the Bitcoin that I devoted the last 7
years of my life to promoting. Bitcoin is BCH
"Bitcoin Cash is everything that Bitcoin was supposed to be, before it was
taken over by a small group of radically minded Core developers, largely
through propaganda and censorship."
I just bought 50 Bitcoin (BCH) ATM machines for a bit under half a million
dollars. Thanks to our purchase the manufacturer has agreed to roll out BCH
support to their existing 1000+ machines world wide!
Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.
