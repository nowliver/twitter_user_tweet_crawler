I can not express how bullish I am on bitcoin. We are at risk of losing the
entire system right now. I know they will find a way to save it but all trust
is lost. Gold guys/girls - youll be fine too. Its just that
[$BTC](/search?q=%24BTC&src=cashtag_click) has bigger upside, by far but is
riskier than gold
The Dollar Standard: The US Economy fell from 40% of World GDP in 1960 to just
25% today. However, 79.5% of all world trade is conducted in US dollars. 84%
of all non-domestic debt globally is US Dollar debt. Around $100trn of global
debts are denominated in US Dollars.
Bitcoin is eating the world... It has become a supermassive black hole that is
sucking in everything around it and destroying it. This narrative is only
going to grow over the next 18 months. You see, gold is breaking down versus
bitcoin...and gold investors will flip to BTC
The significance of the worlds greatest and most respected money manager -
Stan Druckenmiller saying just now that he is long bitcoin can not be
overstated. That has removed every obstacle for any hedge fund or endowment to
invest...

This is huge news. This is the largest asset management firm on earth. 2021 is
setting up to be a year of severe supply shortages vs. demand in Bitcoin, and
upside price dislocations.

Crypto Bomb: Ok, I'm leaking some GMI early... (not published yet - tomorrow
a.m.) I will eventually publish in Real Vision too (this article only). I push
back strongly the Pfeffer view and the "shitcoin" view. It's all Metcalfe's
Law, baby... and ETH = BTC, like it or not.
Danger! : Im going to add a basket of 10 alts to my BTC and ETH bets, using
this dip. Shill me your coin but with a quality paragraph WHY I should look at
it. My knowledge base is low, so treat me like the idiot I am (nicely) Maxi
aggressive "shitcoin" posts = insta bloc Go.
ETH is up 126% YTD. Its Feb 3rd, FFS! I still expect it to hit $20k by around
the turn of the year. The entire DA space is going to consume the performance
of everything else, with BTC as the flag carrier as The Big Asset. It is up
30% YTD hugely beating every other major asset
I, for one, would like to thank

[@100trillionUSD](/100trillionUSD)

for everything he has done for us all. He, almost above all, gave us the
anchor and the framework around to which take risk and understand the power of
BTC, for which all of us owe him a HUGE debt of gratitude. Bravo my friend!
Remember that as the market cap of BTC rises, it forces more institutions into
it. The more institutions that adopt it, the more the others have to and the
harder it is for regulators to stop it. A perfect reflexive loop with the
little guy front running it all. Bravo everyone!
Why no laser eyes? I love the solidarity but I think any celebration or hubris
is dangerous. Heads down and focus on the really big picture and not a $100k
milestone. Filter out all noise and laser concentrate on what matters -
adoption, off exchange, new investment vehicles etc
So, as its Saturday night, I want to ask BTC twitter a question: You are
generally libertainarians in philosophy right? And I am the Founder of a media
platform, that encourage free speech, but if I book someone who is not a
Bitcoiner, you are in outrage. Huh? WTF people.
Next crazy bitcoin take... Me: This project is interesting and might have some
future value Weird BTC twitter: BTC is the only money! This is a scam! Me:
value and money are two different things Weird BTC twitter: scam! Shitcoin!
traitor! Stone him! Stone him! Me: sigh
To be brutally honest, I stare at the chart of ETH/BTC and I see an enormous
rounded bottom with potentially huge breakout just above....
Bitcoin is nearly as oversold as it was in March 2020...
After the weekend FUD fest and shit fighting, let's get back to the important
stuff. BTFD. BTC is forming a wedge most likely...perfectly normal correction
and healthy.
BTC now vs 2017...
Beneath the head line: Crypto had a major, major VAR-shock test and NOTHING
happened. Leverage liquidation was offset by overcollateralisation. No one was
left holding the baby. No firm went under. The Fed didn't need to step in.
Defi didn't break and carried on near normal
To be fair, my flippant comments about the BTC conference being a bit cringe
was a reflection of the media coverage of the more extreme aspects but the
truth is the speakers and many of the attendees are some of the smartest, most
interesting forward thinkers Ive ever known.
Its all a bit weird to me how people can be so ludicrously triggered by
investments - Bitcoin, [$ARK](/search?q=%24ARK&src=cashtag_click),
[$TSLA](/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click), digital assets, NFT's, ESG, etc
It's not like people are killing puppies, they are just investing in a
different vision of where the world is going and that is a market...
Just because perspective is useful for everyone... this is ETH 2021 vs BTC
2017
The Bitcoin long term log chart looks pretty luscious. Who knows if the wedge
breaks on first attempt but a consolidation pattern of this magnitude usually
leads to a very, very powerful upside move.

Things are happening so fast, and with such quantum leaps in NFT world, that I
am struggling to get to grips with it, let alone all of the projects and
breakthroughs. 1/
No idea if BTC breaks out on first attempt or corrects again first but this is
one hell of a pattern.... the on chain analysis also suggests a breakout,
along with S2F.
Issuing the BTC futures ETF is a good step but its basically handing hedge
funds a massive arbitrage opportunity as the futures will trade at a large
premium in bull phases and they get to capture those returns. 1/
The ETH 2021 vs BTC 2017 parallel continues its weird wizardry...
As I said in my recent Real Vision Daily briefing, some people are saying what
the next big macro play? when shall we go long/short of bonds? the $? what's
next for oil? Everyone is missing the point. Crypto is THE biggest macro trade
of all time. Bar none. Crypto IS macro.
Not on holiday yet so I'll allow myself one more thread... The markets are
crazy! NFT are just jpegs! Dog coins! Cat coins! Tesla ! GameStop! Everyone is
going to get burned! Don't they realize about discounted cash flows?!!! These
people are ruining everything! Green energy?!
For the Bitcoin Maxis: when ETH launched it was at 0.0007BTC. 6 years later,
it is at 0.07. That is 100x vs BTC over the period you called it a shit coin.
The whole Pfeffer argument of utility value goes to zero has been proven wrong
due to network effects Facts matter. 1/
The ETH/BTC chart is in my opinion the most important chart in digital asset
markets right now. A break higher will lead to more risk seeking into year
end. BTC will go higher too.
BTC Twitter still stuck in 2015 ETH wars, arguing about who is the harder
money, when ETH is talking about Web 3 and community, not money. Sigh. All of
this can coexist happily and have a symbiotic relationship. It is not
Highlander "There can only be one". One what?
So many chippy comments that I only own about 1 BTC! I am massively
underweight BTC because I think its price appreciates less over time than ETH
and some others. It is not a comment about me being negative BTC. Also, no,
Ive not sold any of my crypto bags to newbie bag holders
Bitcoin IS correlated with risk in the short term, of course it does, it's an
asset and they all do! It is subject to short-term liquidity and behaviour,
but its long-term trend is EXPONENTIAL, unlike most other risk assets. I don't
know why people struggle with
this...[#NOISE](/hashtag/NOISE?src=hashtag_click).
Once you play around in the [$SOL](/search?q=%24SOL&src=cashtag_click)
ecosystem, it feels super fast, slick, inviting and easy for the user. The
best comparison is SOL is Apple and ETH is Android. Both win. Huge.
If you care whether the BTC ETF is priced in or not, your time horizon is too
short. It is all noise in the grand scheme of what lies ahead. Don't fuck This
Up.
