We take the security and integrity of all customer assets seriously and want
to address some recent FUD regarding
[$BCH](/search?q=%24BCH&src=cashtag_click).
[http://Binance.US](https://t.co/PvJ70UVJ8S) maintains 1:1 reserves, which
means for every BCH you hold on our platform, we maintain a BCH in reserve.
The temporary pause we experienced with BCH withdrawals earlier in the week
was caused by a technical issue in our deposit sweeping system. Under normal
conditions, our systems based on predetermined thresholds automatically sweep
funds from our customers individual deposit wallets into our platform's hot
wallets and ultimately to our cold wallets where assets are securely stored.
Going into this past weekend, however, the sweeps from our customers BCH
deposit addresses were not happening automatically (note that this issue did
not affect any other token). As a result, we temporarily paused BCH
withdrawals until the fix was implemented and normal deposit, hot, and cold
wallet flows resumed. Thanks to our tech team who worked over the weekend, BCH
withdrawals on all networks have now been fully operational since late Sunday
night. In an environment where FUD spreads like a virus, we want to reiterate
that [http://Binance.US](https://t.co/PvJ70UVJ8S) was established to serve
U.S. consumers and structured to adhere to U.S. regulations. Rest assured that
your assets remain safe and secure, and no amount of FUD will ever change
that.

My experience with

[@binance](/binance)

. Now, as always in recent years, the world's largest crypto exchange is
getting a lot of fud. Not only regulators are trying to limit the
possibilities for DEXes (and users in the end), but also entire countries in
one form or another are trying to "protect" their citizens more and more by
limiting access to different financial instruments. I am not against
restrictions and regulations. I know that Binance was one of the co-authors of
the innovative legislation for France and the whole of Europe, MICA, which was
supposed to develop the rules of the game and make life easier for ordinary
users and protect their rights. But today is not about that. My experience has
shown that

[@binance](/binance)

has become a salvation for me over the past 3 years. Because of the war, all
external payments from my country were blocked. And since I had some savings
in the bank, if it wasn't for Binance and their p2p service, I would not have
been able to get my money. Also, with the help of the Binance card, I am able
to receive my salary and pay for my daily needs. All over the world. Easily
and securely. Due to certain circumstances, I also switched to Binance earn as
the most stable and profitable way to store my funds and receive passive
income. What's my point? I'm just a simple person, but life would be much more
difficult for me without the features offered by Binance. Looking to the
future, I realize that cryptocurrencies and the modern digital services of
WEB3 will not disappear. That's why I registered a sub-account and save money
for my daughter's education there) Because I know that in 18 years they will
be there+ with a good % on top. My post is a regular user's post, a post of a
person who is grateful for everything that

[@cz_binance](/cz_binance)

Today, I stepped down as CEO of Binance. Admittedly, it was not easy to let go
emotionally. But I know it is the right thing to do. I made mistakes, and I
must take responsibility. This is best for our community, for Binance, and for
myself. Binance is no longer a baby. It is time for me to let it walk and run.
I know Binance will continue to grow and excel with the deep bench it has. Im
pleased to announce that

[@_RichardTeng](/_RichardTeng)

, our now former Global Head of Regional Markets, has been named the new CEO
of Binance today. Richard is a highly qualified leader and, with over three
decades of financial services and regulatory experience, he will navigate the
company through its next period of growth. He will ensure Binance delivers on
our next phase of security, transparency, compliance, and growth. Prior to
joining Binance, Richard was CEO of the Financial Services Regulatory
Authority at Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM); Chief Regulatory Officer of the
Singapore Exchange (SGX); and Director of Corporate Finance in the Monetary
Authority of Singapore. With Richard and the entire team, Im confident that
the best days for

[@Binance](/Binance)

and the crypto industry lay ahead. As a shareholder and former CEO with
historical knowledge of our company, I will remain available to the team to
consult as needed, consistent with the framework set out in our U.S. agency
resolutions. Whats next for me? I will take a break first. I have not had a
single day of real (phone off) break for the last 6 and half years. After
that, my current thinking is I will probably do some passive investing, being
a minority token/shareholder in startups in areas of blockchain/Web3/DeFi, AI
and biotech. I am happy that I will finally have more time to spend looking at
DeFi. I cant see myself being a CEO driving a startup again. I am content
being an one-shot (lucky) entrepreneur. Should there be listeners, I may be
open to being a coach/mentor to a small number of upcoming entrepreneurs,
privately. If for nothing else, I can at least tell them what not to do. On
that note, I am proud to point out that in our resolutions with the U.S.
agencies they: \- do not allege that Binance misappropriated any user funds,
and \- do not allege that Binance engaged in any market manipulation. Funds
are SAFU! With that, I look forward to seeing the new leadership take the
reins. Please join me in congratulating Richard on his well-deserved
promotion. Onwards! CZ
