Harvard just announced theyre charging the full $50k a year for 100% remote

LMAO we have $47,000 Bitcoin and they're about to inject $1.9 trillion into
the economy. Buckle up.

problem, you are in for a rude awakening.
Tesla reported $721M in profit last year. They've already made ~$725M off
their Bitcoin investment. Elon Musk is a legend.
Tesla bought $1.5 billion of Bitcoin around $33,000. That means they have now
made over $1 billion on that investment in less than 45 days. Elon Musk is a
legend.
If you liked Bitcoin at $58,000 then you should love it at $44,000.

This is incredible.

, but the man sold his company for ~ $500 million and then just got 100% of it
